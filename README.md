# Challenge AtixLabs - Gallery and Sheets front-end

This is a nice challenge for [AtixLabs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atix-labs/)

## Description

In this project we created a webapp where is possible to upload PNG files and Sheet files. We will have two pages to see your uploaded files. And best part: It's all serverless!

## Warning

If you refresh your browser you will lost your files because it's all in cache.

## Requirements

We just need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to run this project.\
Clone this repository and use the node package manager to install the dependencies.

### `npm install`

Once you have all dependencies installed you should be able to run the proyect with the following command:

### `npm start`

If you want to create a release version use:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Acknowledgment

I want to say thanks to Alan Verbner for this oportunity.
